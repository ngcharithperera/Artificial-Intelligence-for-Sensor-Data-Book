# Sensor Types




**Environmental Sensors**


**Particulate Matter (PM) Sensors:** Particulate Matter (PM) sensors are devices used to detect and measure the concentration of particulate matter in the air. These sensors are crucial tools in environmental monitoring, public health research, and regulatory compliance, providing real-time data on air quality. Understanding the different types of particulate matter and how these sensors work is essential for accurately assessing air quality and its impact on health. Particulate Matter (PM) refers to a mixture of tiny particles and droplets suspended in the air. These particles vary in size, composition, and origin, and they can be solid or liquid. Particulate matter is classified primarily by size, which significantly impacts its behavior in the atmosphere and its potential health effects on humans.


**Ozone (O₃) sensors:** Ozone (O₃) sensors are devices used to detect and measure the concentration of ozone in the air. Ozone is a critical component of the atmosphere, both beneficial and harmful depending on its location. While it plays a protective role in the stratosphere by blocking harmful ultraviolet radiation, ground-level ozone is a significant air pollutant with adverse health and environmental effects. Ozone sensors are therefore essential tools for monitoring air quality and ensuring public safety.
